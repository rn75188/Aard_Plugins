Bypass: Maintains a list of areas to bypass, and automatically sets as you hit the specific level.

Keyring: Type "keyring_clean" and it will remove all duplicate keys from your keyring, keeping just the most recent copy.

Galabans Moons: Not my script, just changed the output to give a date-time when 3 moons is next expected (original just gives # of ticks)

Pup Tracker: Still in development. Tracks SH pup speed and gold per second and can report averages across areas, subclasses, and date ranges. Additionally, tracks the average rare exp earned by area at any level (requires DB Browser or similar to view).
